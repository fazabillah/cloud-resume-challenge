  lead: "I started my career managing energy infrastructure projects where downtime cost millions. I learned to obsess over uptime, coordinate distributed teams, and automation. Somewhere between building system tools and transforming manual processes, I realized something: I wasn't just managing infrastructure, I was engineering reliability. And I wanted to do more of it. So I made the shift to cloud engineering. Now I work with AWS, Azure, Terraform, and Kubernetes to build the same resilient, automated systems I used to manage; except now they scale globally, deploy in minutes, and don't require physical offshore platforms. Currently building multi-cloud serverless architectures, writing IaC modules, and exploring how AI can improve operational efficiency. Always learning, always automating, and still allergic to manual deployments."
