  lead: "I started my career managing energy infrastructure projects where downtime cost millions. I learned to obsess over uptime, coordinate distributed teams, and automation. Somewhere between building system tools and transforming manual processes, I realized something: I wasn't just managing infrastructure, I was engineering reliability. And I wanted to do more of it. So I started to learn and doing hands on project related to DevOps/Cloud Engineering."
